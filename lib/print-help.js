${at} (read as 'at') is a flexible command-line program used to read, iterate over,
transform, and create text.

${at} achieves this by leveraging:

- Unix stdio streams
- JSON (de)serialization
- and JavaScript evaluation

It's suitable for use-cases such as:

- Executing a CLI command once for each file in the current directory

- Transforming lines of text from one format into another (change colons into
  equals signs, remove prefixes/suffixes from each line, etc)

- Parsing an arbitrary text structure into JSON

- Formatting and printing the data in a JSON file as human-readable text,
  with colors

The goal of ${at} is to make text transformation and file iteration easier to do
on the command-line. It supercharges the sed/awk/grep/xargs workflow by
exposing the full power of JavaScript in a way that doesn't require writing .js
files or learning Node.js APIs.

${kleur

    "Basic Usage                                                                     "
  )}

Here's how it works:

- When you pipe into ${at}, it gathers all of the data it receives on stdin as a
  string.

- If that string contains JSON, it parses it into a JSON object.

- Then, it passes your input string/object into a JavaScript function, that
  you provide on the command-line.

- Finally, the result of your function is written to stdout.

Here's an example of what it looks like:

${kleur.blue("ls")} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(
    `'data => data.split("\\n")'`
  )}

This command line does the following:
- lists all the files in the current working directory (${kleur.blue("ls")})
- pipes (${kleur.green("|")}) the output of that command into ${at}
- instructs ${at} to transform that input string by using
  the JavaScript function '${highlight('data => data.split("\\n")')}}'.
- prints the result of that function to stdout.

The function receives that input data as a string, and because it uses the
string's "split" method, it returns an Array.

Whenever the function you give to ${at} returns something other than a string,
${at} checks if that object can be represented using JSON without losing any
important information.

If so, then ${at} will use JSON.stringify on it prior to printing it to stdout.
As such, the above command line will output something like this:

[
  ${kleur.yellow('"bin"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('"lib"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('"LICENSE"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('"node_modules"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('"package.json"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('"package-lock.json"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('"README.md"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('""')}
]

Because ${kleur
    .bold()
    .blue("@")} will automatically parse any JSON it receives as
input, this output can be piped into ${at} ${kleur.italic("again")} to transform
it further:

${kleur.blue("ls")} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(
    `'data => data.split("\\n")'`
  )} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(`'data => data.slice(0, 3)'`)}

The above command line passes the resulting array back into ${at} again, where
it gets sliced into a subarray containing the first 3 items. As such, the above
command line would output:

[
  ${kleur.yellow('"bin"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('"lib"')},
  ${kleur.yellow('"LICENSE"')}
]

  )}

You might be thinking:

${kleur.bold().dim("|")} "I dunno, that looks kinda janky"

And if so, I wouldn't blame you. I'll be the first to admit that writing
JavaScript expressions embedded inside single-quoted shell strings isn't
exactly a great experience.

However, I felt the idea of combining the shell and JavaScript was still really
enticing. So, I designed ${at}'s API with the goal of improving that experience as
much as possible.

In order to facilitate that, I added several features to ${at}:

${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

${kleur.magenta(
  "1."
)} ${kleur.bold(`If your input function string starts with ${kleur.yellow(
    "'.'"
  )}, it'll automatically be
   prefixed with ${kleur.yellow("'input => input'")}.`)}
${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

Therefore, instead of writing this:

${kleur.blue("ls")} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(
    `'data => data.split("\\n")'`
  )} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(`'data => data.slice(0, 3)'`)}

You can write this:

${kleur.blue("ls")} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(
    `'.split("\\n")'`
  )} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(`'.slice(0, 3)'`)}

This can also be used to access nested properties on an object:

${kleur.blue("cat")} package.json ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(
    `'.version'`
  )}


${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

${kleur.magenta("2.")} ${kleur.bold(
    `If your input function string starts with ${kleur.yellow(
      "'.['"
    )}, that ${kleur.yellow("'.['")} will be replaced
   with ${kleur.yellow("'input => input['")}.`
  )}
${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

This is similar to feature #1; it gives you the same conveniences, but for
number keys and computed property access:

${kleur.blue("ls")} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(
    `'.split("\\n")'`
  )} ${kleur.green("|")} ${at} ${kleur.yellow(`'.[0].toUpperCase()'`)}


${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

${kleur.magenta("3.")} ${kleur.bold(
    `You can use ${kleur.magenta("--target")} or ${kleur.magenta(
      "-t"
    )} to apply the function to only the value found at a
   specific property path, ${kleur.italic(
     `and you can use ${kleur.red("*")} as a wildcard.`
   )}`
  )}
${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

This reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed to access and modify
structures. For instance, given this data structure:
${highlight(`
[
  {
    label: "Pizza",
    tags: ["italian", "cheese", "umami"],
  },
  {
    label: "Ice Cream",
    tags: ["dessert", "cold", "sweet"],
  },
  {
    label: "Red Bean Buns",
    tags: ["snack", "warm", "sweet"],
  },
]
`)}
If you wanted to capitalize the first letter of each tag, you might need to
write a function like this:
${highlight(`
input => input.map(food => {
  ...food, tags: food.tags.map(tag => tag[0].toUpperCase() + tag.slice(1))
})
`)}

Which is a really long function to write on the command-line, with lots of
opportunity for mismatched parentheses and brackets.

Instead, you can use ${kleur.magenta(
    "--target"
  )} to point the function at multiple deep object
property paths in the data structure:

${at} --target '*.tags.*' 'tag => tag[0].toUpperCase() + tag.slice(1)'


${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

${kleur.magenta("4.")} ${kleur.bold(
    `${at} makes several helpful globals available to your function.`
  )}
${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

Node.js has a lot of powerful APIs; for instance, the ${kleur.yellow(
    "child_process"
  )} API
is super useful for spawning subprocesses and subshells. However, it's not
really suitable for use in small function strings on the command line. As such,
${at} offers an alternative: the ${kleur.bold("exec")} function.

${kleur.bold(
  "exec"
)} is a wrapper around shelljs's exec function. It's available as
a global inside of functions you pass to ${at}.

If you call it with a string:
${highlight(`
exec("echo hi")
`)}
It'll run that command in a subshell, then return its stdout as a string.

Additionally, if the command exits with a nonzero status code, ${kleur.bold(
    "exec"
  )}
will throw an Error with the stdout/stderr/code of the command.

In addition to ${kleur.bold("exec")}, ${at} also makes all of the functions
from the kleur package available as globals:

- reset
- bold
- dim
- italic
- underline
- inverse
- hidden
- strikethrough
- black
- red
- green
- yellow
- blue
- magenta
- cyan
- white
- gray
- grey
- bgBlack
- bgRed
- bgGreen
- bgYellow
- bgBlue
- bgMagenta
- bgCyan
- bgWhite

These functions can be used to style text and change its color:
${highlight(`
bold("IMPORTANT")
`)}
${highlight(`
red("FAILURE")
`)}
${highlight(`
bold(green("SUCCESS!"))
`)}
${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

${kleur.magenta("5.")} ${kleur.bold(
    `${at} will automatically attempt to call require on your behalf if you access an
   undefined global.`
  )}
${kleur.bold().underline(" ".repeat(80))}

Libraries in your local ${kleur.yellow("node_modules")} folder can be super
helpful, but trying to write a 'require' call inside of a shell string can be
a little inconvenient; you have to make sure to use a different quote from the
one you're wrapping your entire function with, or else you'll have to escape
stuff, and.... it just gets dicey.

So, ${at} will do its best to automatically require node modules for you.
Here's some examples of what it can do:

- accessing "fs" as a global auto-requires the "fs" module
- accessing "child_process" as a global auto-requires the "child_process"
  module
- accessing "changeCase" as a global auto-requires the "change-case" module
  (if present in node_modules)
- accessing "__babel_types" as a global auto-requires the "@babel/types"
  module (if present in node_modules)

The general rule is that you should write your module name using camelCase
instead of kebab-case. In the case of scoped packages, you should replace
the @ sign with two underscores, and the slash with one underscore (this is the
same convention that the @types stuff on npm uses).
